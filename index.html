Kaya If there's something that bothers you, always tell me kaagad okie? Don't bottle it up, sasabhin na you're okay but nahahalata sa actions mo na hindi or hide it away from me cause I'm always here to listen and I'll do my best to help and support you tsaka how mai supposed to comfort and lambing you if di mo sasabihin sakin kaagad ToT and lastly, i would never get tired of you because you never did sakin kaya don't be afraid to tell me jfjddjdjebsjebj I really wish na i could take away your troubles and pain in exchange na papunta sakin, kasi i would literally do that. I don't like seeing you being hurt over and over againjfjfjrr :((
